# AIPaperX: A one-stop search engine for top-tier AI conference papers

## 📝 About The Project

This project aims to systematically collect and organize the published paper metadata from top-tier conferences in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Computer Vision (CV), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Machine Learning (ML).

To facilitate quick retrieval, statistical analysis, and secondary development for researchers and developers, all paper metadata is archived into folders by **Conference Name** and subsequently by **Year**. The data is uniformly extracted into a highly readable JSON format.

### 📄 Data Format Specification

Each JSON file represents a collection of papers for a specific conference in a given year. The data is stored in a dictionary (Key-Value) structure for simplicity.

## 🛠️ Quick Start

You can directly download the corresponding JSON files and easily parse them using Python:

``` python
import json

# Load CVPR 2026 paper data
with open('./CVPR/cvpr_2026.json', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    papers = json.load(f)

# Print the first 5 papers
for paper in papers[:5]:
    print(f'Title: {paper["title"]}\nURL: {paper["url"]}\n')
```
